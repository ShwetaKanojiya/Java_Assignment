#  Core Java Concepts Overview

This repository captures my focused exploration of **Core Java**, where I have engaged with advanced concepts that are fundamental to building real-world software solutions. Through hands-on implementation and modular design, I have bridged the gap between theory and practiceâ€”working with key topics such as collections, exception handling, multithreading, I/O streams,
and menu-driven programming.  
ntainable applications.

## Topics Covered
### ðŸ”¹ Exception Handling
Robust error management with:
- `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`
- Custom exceptions
- Checked vs Unchecked exceptions

### ðŸ”¹ Multithreading
Concurrent execution using:
- `Thread` class, `Runnable` interface
- `synchronized` blocks
- Thread lifecycle and management

### ðŸ”¹ Java I/O Streams
File and data operations via:
- `FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`
- `InputStream`, `OutputStream`
- Reading/writing text and binary files

### ðŸ”¹ Menu-Driven Application
Real-world console-based system:
- **Inventory Management System**
- Uses `switch-case` logic
- Combines all above concepts into a cohesive project
